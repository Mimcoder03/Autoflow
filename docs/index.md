# 🚀 ProdigyFlow — Intelligent Data Analytics Agent

ProdigyFlow is an **AI-powered multi-agent data analytics framework** designed to automate end-to-end exploratory analysis, visualization, insights generation, and reporting. It enables students, analysts, and researchers to turn raw datasets into meaningful business insights with minimal manual effort.

This project demonstrates the use of intelligent autonomous data pipelines in real-world scenarios.

---

## Project Motivation — Why We Chose This
In real-world business environments, analysts spend **70–80% of time cleaning, exploring, and summarizing data** before any modelling or decision-making. This process is repetitive, time-consuming, and prone to error.

We wanted to build a system that:
- **Speeds up exploratory analysis**
- **Automatically generates insights and visual summaries**
- **Allows anyone to analyze datasets without advance ML knowledge**
- Demonstrates practical learning combining **Python + Data Analytics + Gemini AI**

ProdigyFlow reflects our goal to create **simple, useful, modular tools** that solve real analytical problems while being easy for students and businesses to adopt.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Build a backend-first analytics automation system using agent architecture.
- Support data ingestion, cleaning, visualization, metadata extraction, and insight generation.
- Utilize **Gemini models** for natural-language summaries and understanding.
- Create a structured, competition-ready engineering pipeline.
- Deliver high-value analytical output with minimal coding.

## 🧪 Running the Project Locally

### **1️⃣ Create and activate virtual environment**

```bash
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\activate         
source .venv/bin/activate   

```

### **2️⃣ Install dependencies**  

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### **3️⃣ Run the Analysis Agent**
